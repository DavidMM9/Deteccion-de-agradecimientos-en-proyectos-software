<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In Synechocystis 6803, the ferredoxin 5 (Fd5) phosphoprotein and the S/T protein kinase SpkG are encoded by the slr0148 and slr0152 genes, respectively, which belong to the slr0144-slr0152 cluster. Using a targeted proteomic approach, we showed that SpkG is responsible for the phosphorylation of Fd5 on residues T18 and T72. Sequence alignments and Fd5 structure modelling suggest that these phosphorylation events modulate protein-protein interaction. Furthermore, Fd5 phosphorylation is affected by the Slr0151 protein encoded by the gene preceding spkG in the gene cluster. We propose that Slr0151 functions as an auxiliary protein in the regulation of the ratio between phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of Fd5.</p></div>

SpkE is probably involved in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, while SpkG was shown to play role in salt stress response, positively regulating expression of 15 genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Zorina et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> demonstrated that SpkC, SpkF and SpkK are involved in phosphorylation of the small chaperonin GroES. However, regulation, function, and substrate recognition of Synechocystis 6803 S/T protein kinases remain poorly investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In particular, the field is lacking studies directed to establishing relationships between a discrete S/T protein kinase and individual phosphorylation site(s) in various phosphoproteins of Synechocystis 6803 and other cyanobacteria.</p><p>In Synechocystis 6803, SpkG protein kinase is encoded by the slr0152 gene which belongs to the cluster of nine genes, slr0144-slr0152, located closely to each other. The cluster has been described as the photosystem II assembly proteins (PAP) operon <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Later, Mitchke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. showed that slr0151 and slr0152 are transcribed separately from the upstream genes, possibly as bicistronic mRNA. Among other proteins, the slr0144-slr0152 gene cluster encodes the Slr0148 protein which has been recently annotated as ferredoxin 5 (Fd5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and shown to be a phosphoprotein, with modified T18 and T72 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> residues <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Here, we demonstrate a relationship between phosphorylation of Fd5 and the SpkG kinase which was revealed by investigation of the Dslr0152(DspkG) mutant of Synechocystis 6803 with the targeted proteomic approach (the selected reaction monitoring, SRM). Moreover, we show that the knockout of slr0151, the gene encoding the protein with the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif and preceding spkG in the operon, caused the increase in Fd5 phosphorylation. The demonstrated interplay of three proteins, Fd5 (Slr0148), Slr0151 and the SpkG kinase (Slr0152), exposes a complexity of S/T protein phosphorylation network in Synechocystis 6803.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construction of slr0152 (spkG) and slr0151 mutants</head><p>The glucose-tolerant WT Synechocystis 6803 strain was used for construction of Dslr0152 and Dslr0151 mutants. The slr0152 (spkG) ORF was disrupted by insertion of the kanamycin resistance cassette (Km-R) into the native PstI site of slr0152. To that, the Synechocystis 6803 DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using primers 1 and 2 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). After digestion with HindIII and NdeI, the PCR fragment was inserted in the pRSET-A vector (Invitrogen) and cloned in Escherichiea coli. Furthermore, the Km-R cassette was inserted into the unique PstI site of the obtained plasmid. The final construct was used for the generation of the Synechocystis 6803 Dslr0152 mutant by the homologous recombination. The Synechocystis 6803 Dslr0151 mutant was produced by replacing the part of ORF encoding Asn15-Gln145 with Km-R. The upstream region was amplified by PCR using primers 3 and 4 with introduced EcoRI and PstI sites respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>). The downstream region was amplified by PCR using the primer 5 with introduced PstI site and the primer 6 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>). The former PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and PstI, the latter one with PstI and BamHI (the native site in the chromosomal DNA), and both were inserted into the pRSET-A/EcoRI-BamHI vector and cloned in E. coli. After the Km-R cassette was inserted into PstI site, the Synechocystis 6803 Dslr0151 mutant was generated as described above. Complete segregation in mutants was confirmed by PCR with primers 1 and 2 for Dslr0152 and primers 3 and 7 for Dslr0151.</p></div>

The RT quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on a Bio-Rad IQ5 system using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). WT and Dslr0151 were analysed in triplicates.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protein isolation and digestion to peptides</head><p>For quantitative proteomic experiments, WT and mutant strains were grown to OD 750 ~1 without the antibiotic. Cultures were collected by centrifugation at 6500 g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed by resuspension in ice-cold deionized water followed by centrifugation in the same conditions. Cells were resuspended in a denaturing buffer A containing 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate (ABC), 9 M urea, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, 20 mM NaF, 5 mM Na 4 P 2 O 7 , 20 mM glycerol 2-phosphate. Cells were broken using zirconium beads (0.15 mm, 5.5 gÁcc À1 , 1 lb, NextAdvanace-cat.no. ZROB015) in a Bullet Blender Ò Homogenizers (Next Advance, Inc., Troy, NY, USA), applying three 5-min pulses with maximum power. The crude extract was supplemented with 1% sodium deoxycholate monohydrate (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature (RT). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 21 000 g for 30 min at RT. Protein concentration was measured using Pierce TM BCA Protein Assay Kit (cat.no. 23225; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For each sample, an aliquot corresponding to 1.3 lg of proteins was adjusted to the 250-lL volume with the buffer A followed by reduction of disulphide bonds with 10 mM tris(2carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) and alkylation with 50 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 30 min at RT in the dark. Proteins were precipitates with five volumes of the ice-cold acetone : ethanol (1 : 1) solution at À20 °C overnight. Furthermore, proteins were dissolved in the buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM NaF, 5 mM Na 4 P 2 O 7 , 5 mM glycerol 2-phosphate) containing 8 M urea, diluted four times to decrease concentration of urea followed by addition of sodium orthovanadate (OV; 5 mM), CaCl 2 (1 mM) and TCPK-trypsin (cat.no. 20233; Thermo Scientific) in a ratio 1 : 25 w/w to the total protein. Digestion was performed at 30 °C overnight. Tryptic peptides were acidified with formic acid (FA) to pH 2-3 and desalted using C18 cartridges (Sep-Pak Vac 3 cc, 500 mg; Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) equilibrated with 5% FA. After washing with 5% FA, C18-bound peptides were eluted with 80% acetonitrile (AcN) in 5% FA and dried in a SpeedVac concentrator SVC 100 (Savant Instruments Inc., Holbrook, NY, USA). Peptides were dissolved in 250 lL of 1% FA, and their amounts were estimated using Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific) and the Pierce TM BCA Protein Assay Kit (cat.no. 23225; Thermo Scientific).</p></div>

For the nonmodified peptides, the SRM assays were designed as follows. The WT tryptic digest was analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in a data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode using a Q Exactive TM Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) connected in-line with an Easy-nLC HPLC system (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were separated on a C18 precolumn (5 9 0.3 mm, PepMap C18, LC Packings) and a C18 nano-column (15 cm 9 75 lm, Magic 5 lm200</p><p>A C18; Michrom BioResources Inc., Sacramento, CA, USA) with a flow rate of 300 nLÁmin À1 , using 0.1% FA, 2% AcN as a buffer A and 0.1% FA, 95% AcN as a buffer B. A 60-min gradient was applied: from 5% to 26% B for 35 min, from 26% to 43% B for 15 min, 43% to 100% B for 2 min followed by 100% B for 10 min. Mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source was operated in the positive ion mode, with ionization voltage of 2300 V. DDA was carried out using the following parameters: MS survey scans were performed in a mass range of 300-2000 m/z with resolution of 17 000. Precursor ions corresponding to peptides of interest were fragmented by high-energy collision dissociation (HCD) with the normalized collision energy (nCE) value of 30 eV, isolation window was 2.0 m/z, MS/MS ion scans were collected in a mass range of 100-2000 m/z with resolution of 17 500, with a 6-sec dynamic exclusion of an ion for fragmentation. The obtained data were analysed using the in-house MASCOT  2.4 (Matrix Science, London, UK) server via Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (ThermoFisher Scientific) as described in Angeleri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dslr0152(spkG) and Dslr0151 mutants of Synechocystis 6803</head><p>To investigate the hypothesis about an interplay of the SpkG protein kinase and phosphorylated Fd5 encoded in the same slr0144-0152 gene cluster, we constructed the Dslr0152 mutant of the glucose-tolerant Synechocystis 6803. The cloning scheme is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The slr0152 gene was interrupted by insertion of the Km-R cassette into the natural PstI site. In parallel, we constructed another mutant where the part of slr0151, the gene which precedes spkG in the operon, was replaced with the Km-R cassette (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The latter mutant was deficient in the Slr0151 protein containing TPRs known to be involved in protein-protein interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The complete segregation of both mutants was confirmed by PCR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A,B</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design of SRM assays for quantification of selected proteins including Fd5 and Slr0151</head><p>To inspect the phosphorylation level of Fd5 in WT and constructed mutants, we applied SRM <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, the targeted LC-MS/MS quantification approach. Earlier we have shown that phosphorylation of Fd5 occurs on T18 and T72 residues <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The SRM assays for VAIEpTNDNLLSGLLGQDLR and TLEVIpTTHNR phosphopeptides which incorporate T18 and T72 were described in Angeleri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. These assays, which have been designed for verification of the Fd5, were ready for quantification experiments. Here, we designed SRM assays for the corresponding nonmodified peptides. The Q1/Q3 transitions based on the most intensive and selective fragment y ions in DDA spectra easily distinguished these peptides in the tryptic digest of the Synechocystis 6803 proteome in the SRM experiments. The retention time values and the characteristic transition groups for the two Fd5 peptides, in phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms, are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Similarly, we designed the SRM assays for several other peptides originated from Fd5 (LDPIDLK, DGSILVEK and SMISQLDDQLQAAK) and Slr0151 (FQGDIQTSLGQQQQAIAANQENLTK and LYFDQGDLDSYEVAR) to monitor the general expression level of these proteins (Skyline file in Doc. S1). We attempted also to make SRM assays for several peptides from SpkG. However, we could not reliably detect any of them in the proteome digest, most probably due to the low abundance of SpkG in the Synechocystis 6803 proteome. Finally, we designed SRM assays for peptides from phycobilisome (PBS) subunits: SIVNADAEAR (ApcA, Slr2067) and ITG-NASAIVSNAAR (CpcB, Sll1577; Skyline file in Doc. S1). Latter peptides represented proteins independent on the PAP operon and were used as controls. The designed SRM assays were submitted to Panorama Public, https://panoramaweb.org.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distinct phosphorylation of Fd5 in spkG and slr0151 knockout mutants</head><p>Preliminary experiments demonstrated that both VAIEpTNDNLLSGLLGQDLR and TLEVIpTTHNR phosphopeptides of Fd5 were abundant in WT cells. Therefore, the quantification was performed on samples comprising the total peptide mixture after trypsin digestion of the proteome, without the TiO 2 enrichment <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Three samples prepared from independently grown cell cultures were assessed for every strain. The results of SRM runs are presented in the Skyline file in Doc. S1. The expression level of a peptide in a sample was estimated as the integrated peak area for all measured transitions of the peptide (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). Average values (for the 3 biological replicas) were normalized to the amounts of peptides present in WT (Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>).</p><p>Results of relative quantification, with standard deviations, are shown in Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3 and 4</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. They revealed the absence of the TLEVIpTTHNR phosphopeptide and the dramatic decrease in the VAIEpTNDNLLSGLLGQDLR amounts in the Dslr0152 (DspkG) mutant. In accordance, enhanced accumulation of the corresponding nonphosphorylated peptides was observed in this strain. Unexpectedly, we detected increased amounts of both phosphopeptides in the Dslr0151 mutant compared to WT. The nonphosphorylated forms of the peptides slightly diminished in the Dslr0151 strain. Three peptides, LDPIDLK, DGSILVEK and SMISQLDDQLQAAK, were monitored as reporters for general protein level of Fd5. The obtained data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>) showed that the slr0152 deletion and consequent elimination of the SpkG kinase did not affect the Fd5 protein expression/accumulation. In the Dslr0151 mutant, the Fd5 protein production was reduced about 15% compared  to WT. Furthermore, two peptides, FQGDIQTSLGQ QQQAIAANQENLTK and LYFDQGDLDSYEVAR, served as controls for the Slr0151 protein expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>). As expected, the Slr0151 protein was absent in the Dslr0151 mutant confirming results of the segregation analysis. Surprisingly, insertion of the Km-R cassette in the middle of the following slr0152 gene and abolishing of the SpkG kinase reduced the expression of Slr0151 to about 50% compared to WT. It was important to test whether the slr0151 deletion affected the expression of the SpkG. Since the SRM detection of the SpkG kinase was not possible, we performed RT-qPCR analysis of slr0152 mRNA in WT and the Dslr0151 mutant. Results showed that insertion of the Km-R cassette into slr0151 and, therefore, elimination of the Slr0151 production did not affect the expression of the downstream slr0152 gene (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>). Last, the PBS peptides, SIVNADAEAR from ApcA, unmodified ITGNASAIVSNAAR and phosphorylated ITG-NApSAIVSNAAR from CpcB, were nearly similarly expressed in all three strains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sequence alignment and the 3D model suggest that Fd5 phosphorylation modifies proteinprotein interaction</head><p>We performed primary sequence alignment of Fd5 from Synechocystis 6803 with orthologous proteins from other four cyanobacteria carrying the PAP operon in their genomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The alignment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>) showed high similarity within the group and the threonines, which are phosphorylated in Slr0148, were strictly conserved.</p><p>To get insights into the physiological role of Fd5 phosphorylation, we made sequence alignment of Fd5 with plant-type 2Fe-2S ferredoxins 1-4 (Ssl0020, Sll1382, Slr1828 and Slr0150 respectively) of Synechocystis 6803. The alignment showed that both phosphorylated sites in Fd5 reside in the conserved ferredoxin domain of plant-type ferredoxins. It is important to note that the positions of T18 and T72 in Fd5 are occupied by negatively charged amino acids (D, E) in the other four ferredoxins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>). Thus, phosphorylation of Fd5, leading to the introduction of negative charges on the matching positions, increased the homology of this protein with the group of the plant-type 2Fe-2S ferredoxins Fd1-Fd4, despite rather moderate general identity/similarity of Fd5 with these four proteins. In addition, the alignment showed the presence of another domain at the C terminus of Fd5 that is not present in other ferredoxins. It was annotated as RNA_pol_Rpb1_2 domain, but its functional importance in Fd5 remains unknown.</p><p>Furthermore, we performed modelling of Fd5 based on the 3D structure of putidaredoxin from Pseudomonas putida (4jws.1.B), which had the highest score of similarity to Fd5 of Synechocystis 6803 according to the Swiss Model program (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6A</ref>). Similarly, Fd5 was modelled based on the structure of Synechocystis 6803 Fd1 (1off.1.A) as a representative of the plant- type 2Fe-2S ferredoxins in this organism (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6B</ref>). Although the reliability of the latter model remained questionable due to the low level of homology, both models predicted the location of phosphorylated residues on the opposite sides of the protein (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6A</ref>) implying possible effect on the protein-protein interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Recent phosphoproteomic studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> of the model unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 have revealed the occurrence of the eukaryotic type, S/T/Y, protein phosphorylations in many proteins involved in various cellular functions. This strongly suggests that cyanobacteria, like other organisms, exploit this posttranslational modification (PTM) for regulation and signalling. However, the network of S/T protein kinases and corresponding phosphorylation sites in cyanobacterial proteins remains scarcely investigated.</p><p>In the current work, we studied a relationship between the S/T protein kinase SpkG and the Fd5 phosphoprotein, both encoded by the slr0144-slr0152 gene cluster in Synechocystis 6803 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. To this end, the Dslr0152 mutant deficient in the SpkG kinase was constructed, and the targeted proteomic approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> was applied to evaluate the level of Fd5 phosphorylation in the mutant compared to WT. In parallel, the Dslr0151 mutant deficient in the TPR-containing Slr0151 protein, encoded by the gene preceding spkG in the gene cluster, was constructed and analysed. The SRM approach used here allows the relative quantification of an individual peptide in various samples but does not permit direct comparison of different peptides, due to their variant behaviour during MS data acquisition. Therefore, the results of the quantitative SRM analyses were normalized to the WT level for each peptide, and no quantitative ratio between phospho-Fd and the nonmodified protein is provided.</p><p>Ferredoxin 5 is phosphorylated on two sites, T18 and T72 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and both threonines are strictly conserved among corresponding proteins in other cyanobacteria possessing the PAP operon (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>). Targeted SRM investigation showed complete absence of T72 phosphorylation and drastically diminished T18 phosphorylation of Fd5 in the SpkG-deficient mutant Dslr0152 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and Skyline file in Doc. S1). In accordance, levels of the corresponding nonmodified peptides increased in the Dslr0152 mutant. Since the absence of SpkG did not affect the general expression level of the Fd5 protein (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>), it can be concluded that the SpkG kinase is indeed involved in phosphorylation of Fd5. The remaining low level of phosphorylation on  The physiological role of the Fd5 protein in Synechocystis 6803 and, in particular, of phosphorylation on its two threonine residues still remains obscure. The sequence alignment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>) revealed that introduction of negative charges on T18 and T72 increases the similarity of Fd5 to plant-type 2Fe-2S ferredoxins. Since, according to the 3D model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>), the phosphorylation-dependent negative charges are most likely located on the opposite sides of the Fd5 protein, it is conceivable that the protein-protein interactions differ whether Fd5 is in phosphorylated or in nonmodified form. In addition to the canonical ferredoxin function, it is possible that the phospho-Fd5 serves as a link between two proteins in some still unknown molecular mechanism.</p><p>Wegener et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> described the slr0144-slr1052 gene cluster as the PAP operon. In contrast, Singh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> noted that slr0151 and slr0152 are not regulated together with the other seven genes. The separate expression of these two genes from the slr1044-slr0150 operon was directly shown by Mitschke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> who analysed the transcriptomics organization of the entire Synechocystis genome, and was corroborated by Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> at the protein level. We observed that  elimination of the SpkG kinase resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of the Slr0151 protein (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>) which could be due to destabilization of bicistronic mRNA transcribed from the slr0151-slr0152 operon. Surprisingly, we observed that the knockout of the other gene in the slr0151-slr0152 operon, resulting in elimination of the Slr0151 protein, caused an increase in Fd5 phosphorylation at both sites as compared to WT, and also slightly decreased the general level of Fd5 expression (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3 and 4A</ref>). Thus, both proteins encoded by slr0151-slr0152 affect Fd5. It is of note that the slr0151 deletion did not disturb transcription of spkG (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>), most probably since the DNA region upstream the start codon of slr0151 as well as the sequence encoding the C-terminal part of Slr0151 remained untouched in the Dslr0151 mutant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>While the function of the SpkG kinase in Fd5 phosphorylation is evident, the mechanism how Slr0151 stimulates this process is unclear. The Slr0151 protein does not have homology with protein phosphatases. It has been previously assigned to assist in regulation of the D1 de novo synthesis and photosystem II (PSII) disassembly/assembly under high light stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> as well as to play an important role in the assembly of photosystem I (PSI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Our results indicate that Slr0151 has yet another function determining the optimal ratio between phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of Fd5, namely preventing its overphosphorylation. Indeed, when the Slr0151 protein is absent (Dslr0151), distinct increase in Fd5 phosphorylation is evident as compared to WT. On the other hand, deletion of spkG (Dslr0152) that eliminates Fd5 phosphorylation, concomitantly induces a significant drop in the amount of the Slr0151 protein. Is this novel function of Slr0151 related to assembly processes of photosystems or not remains an open question since neither Fd5 nor SpkG were found to be associated with PSI or PSII <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</p><p>The existence of auxiliary proteins regulating the levels of protein phosphorylation is well documented in literature. For example, the Ssl3451 protein enhances autophosphorylation of Hik33 kinase in Synechocystis 6803 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>; the effect is conserved in Synechococcus <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Similarly, auxiliary proteins have been reported for other organisms, like E. coli <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, Bacillus subtilis <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, Vibrio cholerae <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> etc. We propose that the Slr0151 protein functions as an auxiliary protein in regulation of the ratio between phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of Fd5. The exact mechanism how the regulation is administered remains unknown but it is possible that the TPR motif present in the Slr0151 protein might play a role in this process.</p><p>The interplay among Fd5, the SpkG kinase and the Slr0151 protein described here sheds light on the complicated protein phosphorylation network in Synechocystis 6803 and expands our knowledge about involvement of auxiliary proteins in protein kinasephosphoprotein relationships. The function of such auxiliary proteins in tuning the balance between phosphorylated and nonmodified forms of a protein might be important for proper responses of cyanobacteria to environmental signals. In addition, auxiliary proteins could provide an additional level of regulation for specific interactions of few protein kinases with numerous target proteins revealed by phosphoproteomic studies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
