<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Seen globally, between 2005 and 2018 the EU has transformed its electricity production base faster than other world regions. However, even though the EU is still the world leader in renewable electricity capacity installed per capita, in terms of total installed capacity China surpassed the EU already in 2013.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The renewable energy share has been continuously increasing at EU level. However, increases in gross final energy consumption are slowing down the pace of growth of the RES share</head><p>The EU wide share of renewable energy in gross final energy use increased from 10.2 % in 2005 to 18.9 % in 2018 and to 19.5 % in 2019, according to the EEA's early estimates. Accordingly, the EU has met its indicative trajectory for 2018 as set out in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). RES are a major contributor to the transition of Europe's energy sector. The rapid development of some renewable energy technologies has already allowed these technologies to achieve high market shares. Today, for solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity, biogas electricity and solid biomass used for heating and cooling, these shares are above, or close to, the 2020 levels anticipated by countries in their national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs), drafted in 2010. This has led to GHG emission reductions in the EU electricity sector, in the heating and cooling sector, and, to a lesser extent, in transport.</p><p>However, despite installed renewable capacity continuing to grow, the average yearly growth in the RES share slowed down in 2015-2019 (average growth of 0.4 percentage points per year), compared to performances recorded between 2005 and 2015 (average growth of 0.8 percentage points per year). This is related to the evolution of gross final energy consumption, which decreased between 2005 and 2014 (by 1.1 percentage points on average), it increased between 2014 and 2017 (by 1.8 percentage points on average) and remained stable in 2018 and 2019 (preliminary estimate).</p><p>( 1 )</p><p>Gross inland consumption of fossil fuels</p><p>Today, the shares of RES in gross final energy consumption continue to vary widely between countries, ranging from over 35 % in countries such as Denmark, Finland, Latvia and Sweden to 10 % or less, in Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, and the Netherlands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Renewable energy sources are mostly used for heating and cooling</head><p>In absolute terms, renewable energy for heating and cooling remains the dominant RES market sector in Europe, comprising nearly half of all the renewable energy consumption. RES made up more than one fifth for this sector: 21.1 % in 2018 and 21.7 % in 2019, according to reported data and early EEA estimates. Since 2005, despite biogas and heat pumps sources having increased faster on average, solid biomass-based technologies prevailed in this market sector.</p><p>In absolute terms, renewable electricity is the second largest RES market sector in the EU. Growth in this sector was driven especially by growth in onshore and offshore wind power and solar PV electricity generation, but also by other RES, such as an increase in biogas for electricity purposes. Around a third of all electricity consumed in the EU in 2018 and in 2019 (32.2 % and 34.1 % respectively) originated from renewable sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The bulk of renewable energy use in transport comes from biofuels</head><p>In the EU transport sector, renewable energy made up 8.3 % of all energy use in 2018 and 8.4 % in 2019, according to reported data and the EEA's early estimates. With renewable electricity currently playing only a small role in transport, the bulk of renewable energy use in this sector comes from biofuels. To prevent potential negative impacts on climate, the environment and interactions with food production from land-use (such as when natural forests and food crops are displaced by biofuels), only certified biofuels that comply with the sustainability criteria under the RED can be counted towards the RED targets. Certification is carried out through voluntary schemes recognised by the European Commission and through national systems set up by the Member States.</p><p>Transport biofuels grew fastest over the period 2005-2018 (at 30 percentage points increase per year, on average), as they increased from a very low level in 2005. Nevertheless, considerable efforts are needed in this market sector in the run-up to 2020 to reach the 10 % RES target at the national and at the EU level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The increased use of renewable energy sources since 2005 allowed the EU to cut its fossil fuel use and the associated greenhouse gas emissions by, respectively, 145 Mtoe and 478 Mt CO2 in 2018</head><p>The additional consumption of renewable energy compared with 2005 levels, allowed the EU-to cut its demand for fossil fuels by 145 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2018. This is equivalent to 13 % of the EU's gross inland consumption of fossil fuels. As a comparison, this amount corresponds to almost the gross final energy consumption of France in 2018 (151 Mtoe). In 2019, the amount of substituted fossil fuels is estimated to have increased by 10 Mtoe to 155 Mtoe.</p><p>These fossil fuel savings due to the additional use of renewable energy after 2005 helped the EU achieve an estimated gross reduction in CO2 emissions of 478 Mt CO2 (12 %) in 2018, compared with a counterfactual scenario in which RES consumption would have stayed the same as in 2005. The estimated reduction in GHG emissions attributed to renewables in 2018 was similar to the total GHG emissions of France the same year. In 2019, the effect on CO2 emissions increased further, resulting in a gross emission reduction of 513 Mt CO2 (a 12 % gross reduction in the EU). Most of these changes took place in energy-intensive sectors covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), as the increase in renewable electricity decreased the reliance on fossil fuels and made up roughly three quarters of the estimated total EU reductions.</p><p>In 2018, the largest relative reductions in the consumption of fossil fuels compared to 2005 were made by Estonia (56 %), Sweden (42 %), Denmark (35 %) and Finland (28 %), in proportion to their gross domestic fossil fuel use. In absolute terms, the greatest quantities of fossil fuels were avoided in Germany, Italy, France and Spain, where most renewable energy was consumed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The increased use of renewable energy sources since 2005 allowed the EU to cut its emissions of NOx and SO2, but caused an increase of PM and VOC emissions</head><p>At the EU level, for 2018, the total estimated RES effect results in a decrease of air pollutant emissions of 44 kt for NOx and 129 kt for SO2, compared with a counterfactual scenario in which RES consumption would have remained at the levels of 2005. However, for PM10, PM2.5 and VOCs emissions, the result is an increase of respectively 122, 120 and 248 kt, compared with 2005. On the relative level, this has led to a decrease of SO2 and NOx emissions in 2018, by 6 % and 1 %, respectively, compared to air pollutant emissions if RES use had remained at the same level of 2005. In contrast, an indicative increase of EUwide emissions for PM and VOCs took place in 2018, following the increase in biomass use since 2005 (by 12 % for PM2.5, 7 % for PM10 and 4 % for VOCs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Globally, 2019 was a strong year for renewable energy, reaching 34 % of the world's total installed power capacity and one quarter of total generation</head><p>In 2019, the world has added 177 GW in net renewable electricity capacity, almost the same as in 2018 and representing a 7 % growth of total installed capacity. As such, renewables accounted for an estimated 71 % of net power generation capacity additions. Since 2012, every year except for 2014, more than half of all newly installed power capacity worldwide was of renewable origin.</p><p>In 2019, China was a clear leader regarding net renewable capacity additions (63 GW). Yet, the EU continued to rank second, after China, as regards total installed renewable electricity capacity, having installed as much as 26 GW of net capacity in 2019 -a record since 2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(IRENA 2020b)</ref>.</p><p>Trends in renewable electricity capacity across the EU show a sharp increase between 2009 and 2013, , coinciding with the adoption of the RED <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(IRENA 2020b</ref><ref type="bibr">, EU 2009)</ref>. The upward trend continued between 2014 and 2018 although less steeply.( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) The agreement on the revised RED (EU 2018a) sets the binding EU target at 32 % renewable energy sources consumption in gross final energy by 2030, subject to a potential upward revision in 2023. It is expected thus that the growth in installed capacity will be high in this period to cope with the demand.</p><p>An increase in investments accompanied the growth in net installed capacity in renewable power. After a reduction in 2018, global renewable energy investments increased again in 2019, amounting to EUR 252 billion. Yet, this was still below the peak reached in 2015( 3 ). In Europe (including the Commonwealth of Independent States ), investments amounted to EUR 49 billion in 2019. Since 2013, annual renewable energy investments have varied between 40 and EUR 65 billion in Europe, being significantly lower than the peak achieved in 2011 (EUR 92 billion) (Frankfurt School- <ref type="bibr">UNEP 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Wind and solar PV systems remain the fastest growing technologies worldwide. More flexibility needs to be added to the energy system to make the most of their variable generation.</p><p>In 2019, wind power represented 22 % of the renewable generation worldwide, while solar PV represented 10 %. New RES capacity additions continued to be dominated by solar PV and wind power</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( 2 )</formula><p>The UK was an important contributor to RES growth in the period 2014-2018 concerning the EU-28, but is no longer accounted for in the current analysis, which concerns the EU-27.</p><p>( 3 )</p><p>In 2015 the all-time high of EUR 287 billion was invested.</p><p>(IRENA 2020b) These technologies accounted for over 95 % of total global RES investments (Frankfurt School- <ref type="bibr">UNEP 2020)</ref>. At the other end, investments in new biofuel dropped drastically in 2019, possibly because of policy uncertainty and limitations for first generation biofuels, for example in Europe, and a still immature market for second generation biofuels.</p><p>The expected future growth of these technologies, which generate independently of the level of consumption, will require more flexibility to be built into the energy system, so as to absorb their variable and inflexible nature and avoid high costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The EU remains a global leader in renewable electricity capacity per capita, but faster activity is visible in other parts of the world</head><p>The average renewable electricity capacity per capita for the EU was two and a half time larger in 2018 compared with 2005 (1 kW per person in 2018), with large differences between Member States. The EU retains its global lead, being closely followed by the United States (at 0.8 kW per capita), the UK and Brazil (both at 0.7 kW per capita). The fastest progress in the last five years can be observed in China, followed by the Middle East and ASOC (except China and India).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Jobs in renewables continued to increase with China as the main employer, while EU comes second</head><p>Jobs remain concentrated in a few countries worldwide, but this was more decentralised in 2019 than 2018. An estimated 11.5 million direct and indirect jobs were related to renewables in 2019, up 4 % from 2018. This is roughly 0.55 % of the total labour force (IRENA 2020c, World <ref type="bibr">Bank 2020)</ref>. China provided 4.4 million jobs, around 38 % of the global renewable employment. The EU is the second employer in the renewable energy sector with 1.2 million jobs, at the same level as Brazil. Jointly with India, the United States of America as well as Japan, Malaysia, Bangladesh and UK follow, these countries host 78 % of the global renewable jobs. Compared to 2017, when these countries summed 84 % of the global renewable workforce, the employment has distributed to other countries.</p><p>In terms of proportion of renewable energy-related jobs in the labour force, Malaysia and Brazil were leaders at 1.2 % and 1.1 % respectively. They were followed by the EU, with 0.66 % of the labour force dedicated to renewable energy, outpacing China at a 0.56 %. Within the EU, Germany remains the number one employer in terms of RES-related jobs.</p><p>Globally, solar PV and bioenergy are the largest employers for direct and indirect jobs in renewables, with a large growth in bioenergy jobs. In Europe, this trend is somewhat reversed, with 62 % of employment coming from bioenergy, followed by wind representing 25 % of renewables jobs, while solar only represents an 11 %.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>To reach the raising 2030 ambitions, Member States and the EU need to intensify their climate and energy efforts</head><p>In the context of the Paris Agreement and to reach the EU climate and energy targets for 2030 and to become a sustainable, carbon neutral economy by 2050, Member States need to overcome a number of important challenges. In their 2019 NECPs, Member States have proposed indicative efforts contributing to the 32 % EU binding target for renewable energy for 2030. The European Commission's assessment of these national RES contributions shows that the EU's share of renewable energy could surpass the 2030 target by approximately 1 % (ranging between 33.1 % and 33.3 %)(EC 2020c). However, reaching a higher EU greenhouse gas emission reduction target of net 55 % by 2030 ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) as proposed by the European Commission under its 2030 Climate Target Plan will require higher shares of renewables, in the range of 38 % to 40 %, in the energy system (EC 2020c).</p><p>To maintain momentum, EU Member States must reinforce and build existing, home-grown expertise and innovation capacity in renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions and radically transform their energy systems. This will also help retain Europe's global competitiveness in these growing knowledge-intensive sectors.</p><p>1 Introduction</p><p>1.1 Background: international and European context On a global scale, the Paris Agreement ( 5 ) (UNFCCC 2015) is the most important driver for fossil fuel divestment. This requires fundamentally transforming our energy system and adjusting our production and consumption patterns on a short term.</p><p>Increased deployment of renewable energy sources (RES) plays an important role in transitioning in a cost-effective way to a resilient carbon neutral economy. With long-term energy demand overall stable in Europe, increasing the share of RES triggers the displacement of non-renewable sources (especially fossil fuels) in power supply, heat production and transport, thereby reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across all sectors. Renewables are a key pillar in delivering the European Energy Union's decarbonisation priority (see Box 1.1), achieving the EU's climate commitments under the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Progress achieved in EU-wide renewable energy deployment since 2005 is largely attributed to the presence of binding national targets for 2020 under the Renewable Energy Directive, or RED <ref type="bibr">(EU 2009)</ref>, and to national support instruments put in place in response to these targets, such as feed-in tariffs, feed-in premiums, auction/tender systems, quotas, tax credits and grants. A broad set of complementary climate and energy policies support low-carbon energy developments and aim to spur innovation in this field. This process of target setting and the policy response to that, not only on EU level but also on a global level, led to technological advances, the scaling up of production volumes and a reduction in costs, especially of wind power and solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies. Nevertheless, the rapid initial developments also triggered frequent adaptation of Member States' policies to establish cost-effective support and, in some cases, even to abrogate that support.</p><p>In 2017-2018, however, the annual pace of growth in the EU has stagnated for most RES technologies. This loss of speed initially took shape in the aftermath of the financial crisis, when many support mechanisms were scaled back, sometimes cut entirely or were retroactively changed. Subsequently, economic growth resumed across countries and, since 2015, energy consumption from non-renewable sources increased by more than that from renewable ones, as a result of increased energy use in the transport sector and low carbon prices in the EU's electricity market till 2018. The increasing number of countries getting closer to, or having reached their renewable energy targets for 2020 ahead of time, may offer a further explanation.</p><p>In 2019, energy consumption from all the sources stayed stable in the EU, increasing only 0.1% compared to 2018, while energy consumption from renewables increased by 3.2%. RES-E sector had the highest increase by 1.9% to 34.1% due to growth in electricity generation from wind and photovoltaics. RES share increased by 0.6% to 19.5% in 2019.</p><p>Despite the slower pace, the EU-27 is on track to meet its 2020 RES target. However, underperformance in RES-T continued (EEA 2020).</p><p>( 5 )</p><p>The Paris Agreement's central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 °C. The Paris Agreement requires all Parties to put forward their best efforts through 'nationally determined contributions' (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead (UNFCCC 2015).</p><p>In 2020, the Covid-19 crisis has had an enormous impact on Europe's energy system. Despite its resilience, it is expected that the crisis will negatively impact the renewable energy industry as well.</p><p>Renewable energy investments therefore need to play a key role in the recovery after the crisis. This report focuses on developments in renewable energy in 2018 and proxy estimates for 2019, and therefore it does not reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the energy system.</p><p>Box 1.1 EU renewable energy policies up to 2020 and 2030</p><p>The EU was an early adopter of renewable energy starting with the implementation of EU-wide policies from the mid-nineties. After the first directive on electricity production from renewable energy sources <ref type="bibr">(2001)</ref> with indicative targets, the review (in 2005) of Member States' supporting schemes led to a period of debate and negotiations between Member States and the EU institutions. This resulted, in 2009, in the RED (2009/28/EC), which set legally binding national targets contributing to an EU-wide target of 20 % renewable energy in the total energy needs by 2020.</p><p>The binding national targets are set at different levels to reflect national circumstances. The EU's renewable energy target for transport (i.e. a 10 % share by 2020) is divided equally for all countries into 10 % national targets, with biofuels produced from energy crops grown on agricultural land limited to a maximum of 7 %. The RED also sets out options for cooperation to help countries achieve their targets cost-effectively.</p><p>In the run-up to 2020, two interim trajectories are of interest in assessing the EU's and Member States' progress towards their binding targets:</p><p>• The minimum indicative RED trajectories for each country. These trajectories concern only the total RES share. They run until 2018, ending in 2020 with the binding national RES share targets. They are provided in the RED to ensure that the national RES targets will be met. • The expected trajectories adopted by Member States in their national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs) under the RED. These NREAP trajectories concern not only the overall RES share but also the shares of renewables in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sectors up to 2020.</p><p>For 2030, the RED II sets a binding EU-wide target of 32 % RES in gross final energy consumption. Member States have proposed national targets contributing to the EU binding target for renewables in their final NECPs including existing and planned policies and measures. The assessment of NECPs shows that the share of renewable energy could reach, under existing and planned measures, a range of 33.1 to 33.7 % in 2030, surpassing the EU's 2030 RES target (ref COM assessment).. Additionally, the RED II also includes:</p><p>• guiding principles concerning financial support schemes for RES-E;</p><p>• the requirement for Member States to set up 'one-stop shops' to coordinate the entire permit-granting process for new RES generation, transmission and distribution capacity; • principles of renewable self-consumption and (local) renewable energy communities;</p><p>• enhancement of existing provisions on cross-border cooperation;</p><p>• provisions to improve the sustainability and GHG emissions-saving criteria for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass; • mainstreaming of renewable heating and cooling (RES-H&amp;C) applications, in particular by asking Member States to increase the share of renewable energy supplied for heating and cooling by a fixed rate (by an indicative 1.3 percentage points for 2021-2025 and higher thereafter) per year, starting from the level achieved in 2020.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outlook beyond 2020</head><p>In June 2018, European countries gave their endorsement to a binding EU-wide renewable energy target of a minimum of 32 % of gross final consumption by 2030, which is included in the recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) that entered into force at the end of 2018. Building on the Energy Union strategy of 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(EC 2015)</ref>, as well as on the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union (EU 2018b) ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), Member States had to propose an indicative level of effort contributing to the EU binding target for renewable energy as part of their final integrated national energy and climate plans, by the end of 2019, taking into account the Commission's recommendations of June 2019 on their draft plans.</p><p>The assessment of NECPs shows that the share of renewable energy could surpass the target of 32 % (see also Box 1.1).</p><p>In September Since the renewable energy target is defined as the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption it is clear that the role of energy savings and improved energy efficiency in gross final consumption cannot be underestimated.</p><p>In the run-up to 2030, the indicative RES trajectory of the EU-27 (based on the collective efforts of the Member States) should reach at least the following reference points for the total increase in the RES share between the binding 20 % RES share target for 2020 and the binding 32 % RES share target for 2030: 18 % by 2022; 43 % by 2025; 65 % by 2027. For EU-27, this would be equal to a RES share of 22 %, 25 % and 28 % in respectively 2022, 2025 and 2028. Should Member States fall behind similar reference points in relation to their RES trajectories in the integrated national energy and climate plans, they will need to implement additional measures to cover the gap within 1 year (EU 2018b). The RED II intends to mainstream renewable energy in heating and cooling and thus includes a trajectory for this purpose. Member States are urged to make an effort to increase the share of renewable energy by an indicative 1.3 percentage points as an annual average calculated for the periods 2021 to 2025 and 2026 to 2030, starting from the share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector in 2020, expressed in terms of national share of final energy consumption. The increase shall be limited to an indicative 1.1 percentage points for Member States where waste heat and cold is not used (EU 2018a).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beyond Europe</head><p>In the past, the EU has been a frontrunner in renewable energy. Nevertheless, with developing countries investing more in green energy than developed economies, the situation may be changing in the short run (see Chapter 4).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Approximated estimates for the share of gross final consumption of renewable energy resources (RES share proxies)</head><p>The EEA 2019 RES shares are, ultimately, estimated values. Although the 2019 RES shares proxies formed the basis of a specific EEA country consultation, carried out in October 2020 ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>), these values are not a substitute for data that countries officially report to Eurostat.</p><p>The methodology applied for approximating RES values in the year t-1 was described in a previous EEA report (EEA 2015) -see also Annex 3. Confidence in the estimated RES share proxy values is greatest in the electricity sector. The dynamics in the renewable heating and cooling market sector may be underestimated due to the more limited data available for this sector. Finally, the specific accounting rules in the RED concerning renewables consumed in transport remain difficult to replicate. Despite these challenges, the estimation of RES share proxies yields plausible results in most cases and should be further improved, especially as more timely information and data that are relevant for the estimations become available.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Newly introduced Eurostat codes and descriptions since 2019</head><p>In January 2019, Eurostat introduced a novel methodology for the energy balances, mostly to harmonise codes and labels with international statistics. To ensure continuity of indicators necessary to assess reporting guidelines, these emissions have to be reported separately in GHG inventories as a memorandum item (mainly to avoid double counting of emissions from a reporting perspective), with the assumption being that unsustainable biomass production would show as a loss of biomass stock in the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector and not in the energy sector.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other observations</head><p>For offshore wind, 2005-2017 data are calculated based on capacities reported by EurObserv'ER, while 2018 and 2019 data are calculated on capacities reported by WindEurope. The decision to go for these sources instead of Eurostat SHARES values came from the incompleteness of the information in the latter source. All the production calculations are based on an assumption of 4 000 full load hours of operation. The offshore wind production is then subtracted from the total wind production reported by Eurostat (Eurostat 2019b) and the result is attributed to onshore wind production. The total of onshore and offshore wind power generation is equal to the total for wind power reported by Eurostat. Data for 2020 originate from table 10 in each country's NREAP, where there is separate reporting for onshore and offshore wind power.</p><p>In the context of renewable energy use in transport the terms 'other biofuels' and 'all biofuels' are understood to also include biogas and other liquid biofuels used in transport. Similarly, in the context of RES-E generation, the term 'solid biomass' is understood to also include renewable municipal waste.</p><p>The methods applied in this report to estimate the impact of the uptake of renewable energy on energy consumption and GHG emissions cannot be used to assign these effects to particular drivers, circumstances or policies, other than the increased consumption of renewable energy itself. These methodologies provide valuable insights, but as the assumptions are static (i.e. the same set of assumptions is applied to all years in the period), assumptions need to be re-adjusted at times to reflect real-life conditions. A detailed description of the methods was given in a previous report (EEA 2015).</p><p>2 Developments in renewable energy sources in Europe • Considering the strong contractions in GDP and energy use during 2020, it appears likely that the EU will meet its 20 % RES target in 2020. If so however, much will have been due to the drastic measures taken to contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus, than solely to the success of domestic policies and measures to promote renewable energy use.</p><p>• At the current pace of growth of 0.7 percentage points annually, the 32 % target by 2030 will not be met. To reach that target, the RES share across the EU will have to grow by an average of 1.1 percentage points, per year, between 2018 and 2030.</p><p>• Across the EU, in absolute terms, the largest market sector for renewable energy use remains heating and cooling. Renewables made up more than one fifth of all final energy consumed in this market sector in 2018 and 21.7% in 2019. In 2018, the largest contributions came from solid biomass (80.0 Mtoe, or 81 % of all RES-H&amp;C), heat pumps (11.4 Mtoe, or 12 % of all RES-H&amp;C) and biogas (3.5 Mtoe, or 4 % of all RES-H&amp;C).</p><p>• Electricity is the second largest market sector for RES in the EU (RES-E share of 32.2 % in 2018 and 34.1 % in 2019 according to the early EEA estimates). In 2018, the largest contributions came from hydropower and wind power (37 % and 34 % of all RES-E, respectively), solar PV systems (12 % of all RES-E) and solid biomass (10 % of all RES-E). All the other technologies made smaller contributions, ranging from 0.1 % (tidal, wave and ocean energy) to 6 % (biogas).</p><p>• Transport is the third and smallest market sector for renewables <ref type="bibr">(8.3 % in 2018 and 8.4</ref>  for the years 2017 and 2018. Having achieved a RES share of 18.9 % in 2018 and an estimated share of 19.5% in 2019, the EU has surpassed its indicative target for 2018. Considering the strong contractions in GDP and energy use during 2020, it appears likely that the EU will meet also its 20 % RES target in 2020 <ref type="bibr">(EU 2009)</ref>. If so however, two major events could be of influence: Brexit and the outbreak of the Covid-19 virus. Including the UK, the RES share would have been 18.0 % in 2018 (and an estimated 18.7 in 2019) -almost one percentage point less than for the EU-27. The Covid-19 outbreak this spring lead to unprecedented decreases in final energy consumption for the target year 2020. Given the lower operational costs of RES compared to traditional power sources, the reduction in consumption probably translates in lower generation from fossil fuels, pushing the share of RES up in the energy mix. The higher CO2 allowances costs for fossil power generators also contribute to this effect. These higher costs are due to the measures the European Commission took in recent years to address the surplus in allowances.</p><p>Compared to its expected NREAP trajectory ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), the  </p></div>

However, since 2005, the largest growth in RES-E capacity per capita has been observed in Cyprus, Estonia, Poland, Belgium, Lithuania, Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Hungary, Czech Republic (all more than 300 % growth), followed by Greece, Italy, Bulgaria, Luxembourg, France, Denmark, Portugal (growth between 200 % and 300 %). The remaining countries (Romania, Spain, Croatia, Finland, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Austria, Sweden showed lower growth rates (&lt; 200 %). Only in four EU countries (Lithuania, Malta, Poland and Hungary) the installed capacity per capita remained below the world average (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">34</ref>). It must be noted that the RES-E capacity per capita is just one indicator and that it does not necessarily reflect the local conditions for RES development in a country well. It is included here however to make the comparison with the global RES-E capacity and with other world regions (see Chapter 4). Similar to the average RES-E capacity per capita, the average RES-E capacity per unit of GDP for the EU has more than doubled since 2005, reaching 28 kW/GDP ( 13 ) in 2018. Bulgaria, Latvia, Sweden and Romania had the largest installed capacities per unit of GDP (58 kW/ million EUR2015 (PPP) or more) followed by Portugal, Croatia, Greece, Spain, Austria and Germany (35 to 57 kW/million EUR2015 (PPP)).</p><p>The largest growth in RES-E capacity per GDP since 2005 can be observed in Malta, Cyprus, Belgium, Estonia, Poland and the Netherlands (all more than 450 % growth), followed by Lithuania, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy and Czech Republic (between 150 % and around 250 % growth). The remaining countries (Luxembourg, France, Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Bulgaria, Finland, Croatia, Austria, Slovenia, Sweden and Romania) showed lower growth rates (&lt; 130 %) while Slovakia and Latvia showed negative growth rates per unit of GDP.

Hydropower projects may negatively impact water bodies, adjacent wetlands and the habitats where they are installed, their operation impacting directly certain rare and threatened species protected under EU nature legislation. To minimise such impacts, measures targeting fish migration, habitat restoration or sediment management need to be implemented in accordance with the Water Framework Directive.

Although an increase of 7 percentage points per year, on average, in the period up to 2020 would be sufficient to meet expectations in the NREAPs, in reality wind power could continue to grow more rapidly until 2020, given the cost reductions that have taken place over the past 10 years.</p><p>In 2018, the greatest increase in normalised onshore wind production, in absolute terms was recorded in Germany, followed by France and Ireland (respectively 0.66, 0.28 and 0.10 Mtoe) while the largest increases, in relative terms, could be observed for Finland, Ireland, France and Luxembourg (respectively 20 %, 15 %, 13 % and 12 %).</p><p>In 2019, Spain was the largest installer, with 2.15 GW additional onshore capacity, followed by Sweden and France (respectively 1.68 GW and 1.36 GW). Germany with 0.96 GW, not including 0.08 GW decommissioned, again installed less than in 2017 and 2018 (respectively 2.4 and 5.3 GW installed). The main reasons for the considerable slowdown in deployment in Germany were the new regulatory requirements which led to delays in permitting. The principal requirement slowing down the process is the requirement of siting onshore wind turbines more than 1000 metres from residential areas. A few years ago, the lead time for a license was only 10 months while this nowadays runs up till more than two years. In 2019 the Spanish market revived due to the launch of two renewable energy tenders in 2017. In France the addition of new capacity again decreased compared to 2018 (1.5 GW net installed In 2018) (EurObserv'ER 2020c). Sweden more than doubled its capacity in 2019 compared to 2018 (from 0.72 GW in 2018 to 1.59 GW in 2019). This trend is expected to remain in the next years, but the joint Swedish-Norwegian electricity certificate is set to phase out after 2021 and it remains to be seen what the impact will be.

Default GHG emission values and calculation rules are provided in Annex V (for liquid biofuels) and Annex VI (for solid and gaseous biomass for power and heat production). The RED II also includes new sustainability criteria for forestry feedstocks and requires that harvesting takes place with legal permits, the harvesting level does not exceed the growth rate of the forest, and that forest regeneration is ensured. Further, it requires that biofuels and bioenergy from forest materials comply with requirements which mirror the principles from the EU Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation (EU 2018a).

A further five Member States (France, Italy, Poland, Hungary and Belgium) added between 0.5 GW and 1 GW in 2019 (EurObserv'ER 2019a).

To be successful, the offshore wind sector needs to deliver the objectives of the EU integrated maritime policy's Blue Economy agenda and comply with nature and marine-related legislation and objectives. The guidance for siting wind projects compatible with protecting biodiversity and Europe's natural heritage developed by the European Commission also applies to offshore wind energy (EC 2011).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Solid biomass</head><p>Solid biomass remains the largest source of renewable energy for heating (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">13</ref>) and since 2015 it exceeded the NREAP levels expected for 2020. The consumption of renewable heat originating from solid biomass decreased for the first since 2014, from 81.1 Mtoe in 2017 to 80.0 Mtoe in 2018. Heat from solid biomass increased by 2 percentage points per year, on average, over the period 2005-2018. In 2019, the consumption of solid biomass for renewable heat stayed in 81.5 Mtoe, according to the early EEA estimate, exceeding the expected NREAP level for 2019 by 6.7 Mtoe.</p><p>Climate has a strong impact on the burning of solid biomass for heat production. From 2010 on, for the years in which the heating degree days across the EU went down substantially year-on-year, compared to the year before (2011 and 2014), it can be observed that also the heat generation from biomass went down (Eurostat 2020b).</p><p>While heat from solid biomass sold to heating networks remained at the same level, the amount of heat from solid biomass directly used by final consumers across the EU decreased in 2018 (by 1.5 % compared to 2017 levels), because of the decrease in residential wood energy consumption in France, Italy and Sweden (EC 2019).</p><p>For the period starting with 2021, the new Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) (EU 2018a) has introduced sustainability requirements also for solid and gaseous bioenergy, in order to ensure robust GHG emission savings and to minimize unintended environmental impacts from this energy source. It contains a new approach to address emissions from indirect land-use change (ILUC) caused by the production of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. Therefore, it sets national limits, which will gradually decrease to zero by 2030 at the latest, for high ILUC-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from food or feed crops. These limits will affect the amount of these fuels that can be taken into account when calculating the overall national share of renewable energy sources and the share of renewables in transport. However, the RED II also introduces an exemption from these limits for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels that are certified as low ILUC-risk (EC 2019). </p></div>

In northern Europe, most heat pumps are used for heating, but elsewhere there is also a market for cooling. In 2018, Italy and France contributed 23 % to final EU-wide RES consumption from heat pumps. Sweden (13 %) and Germany (10 %) also made significant contributions.</p><p>Four million systems were sold in 2018 in the EU, which amounts to a 10.5 % increase compared to 2017. However, in relative terms this is still less than the growth rates recorded in 2015 and 2016 (20 % and 26 %, respectively) but again more than the growth rate recorded in 2017 <ref type="bibr">(4.4 %)</ref>. The increased growth rate in 2018 can be explained by the increase in demand for reversible air-to-air heat pumps mainly used as cooling in Italy but also in Spain, Portugal and France which experience higher summer comfort needs. But also, for the waterborne systems mainly used for heating purposes sales have been increasing since 2013. Between 2017 and 2018 they increased by 21.5 % (more than 366 200 units) both in the historic markets for these systems as well as in less mature markets (EurObserv'ER 2018).</p><p>Reversible air-to-air heat pumps continue to lead sales (3.1 million units in 2017), being the preferred choice in home renovations.

For the transport sector, the RED includes a target of 10 % and at current pace this target would not be met by 2020.</p><p>• The gross final consumption of certified biofuels was 15.4 Mtoe in 2018, which is a 11 % increase compared with 2017. • According to proxy estimates, the RES-T share grew from 8.3 % in 2018 to 8.4 % in 2019.</p><p>• To realise the expectations in the NREAPs for 2020, an increase of 43 percentage points per year, on average, would be required over the remainder of the period 2018-2020. The use of RES-E in road transport in the EU was 45.9 ktoe in 2018, an increase by more than 20% from 37.8 ktoe in 2017, and is estimated to be 49.0 ktoe in 2019. The amount of RES-E used in other transport modes was almost 1.8 Mtoe ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) in 2018 and is estimated to overcome 1.8 Mtoe in 2019. From 2005 to 2010, the gross final consumption of biofuels increased strongly from 3.1 Mtoe to 12.0 Mtoe (all biofuels including non-compliant ones), followed by a moderate increase to 12.6 Mtoe in 2012 and then more or less plateaued until 2016 to increase again moderately in 2017 and 2018 to respectively 13.9 Mtoe and 15.4 Mtoe (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">17</ref>). The EEA estimates that the use of biofuels in transport was 15.8 Mtoe in 2019. Most countries' consumption of biofuels is below the expected realisations in their NREAPs, but there is no clear EU-wide trend.</p><p>The transport sector has a separate RES target for 2020, which is equal to a 10 % share of renewable energy consumption in each Member State.</p><p>The RED (EU 2009) included sustainability criteria for biofuels that can be accounted towards the national targets. These criteria include minimum greenhouse gas emission savings and that raw materials for biofuels must not come from certain land areas, to avoid adverse environmental effects. For social and economic sustainability, it is requested that Member States report every two years to the European Commission on inter alia the impact on food prices, land rights, and ratification of main producer countries of international labour conventions. Since 2010, the share of non-certified biofuels decreased sharply, from 42 % in 2011 to less than 1 % in 2018. The RED II (EU 2018a) further limits the use of high ILUC-risk biofuels, produced from food and feed crops that have a significant global expansion into land with high carbon stock such as forests, wetlands and peatlands. These additional requirements will affect the amount of fuels that Member States can take into account for their overall national share of renewables and the share of renewables used in transport. Member States still can use (and import) fuels covered by these limits, but these fuels will not be counted towards the national renewable energy targets, nor will they be entitled to receive any form of financial support. The requirements consist of a freeze at 2019 levels for 2021-2023 and the levels will gradually decrease from the end of 2023 to zero by 2030.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key messages:</head><p>• Having a digitalized and flexible energy system is essential to increase the uptake of variable renewable energy, notably from wind and solar sources, and to reach the EU binding targets for 2030 and the carbon neutrality goals for 2050.</p><p>• Many technologies that support flexibility and smart system management have become more affordable. This includes technologies for households. There are challenges that remain: it is key to foster research and development to further lower the costs and increase the efficiency of technology, and for regulators and system operators to incentivize the use of flexibility solutions.</p><p>• Challenges related to the behavior and trust of consumers, notably households and small businesses, are important to consider. This includes the effects of incentives to use and purchase flexible products such as dynamic tariffs, where prices change according to the day ahead price, or third party that manages remotely the consumption in exchange of payments.</p><p>• The European Commission is prioritizing flexibility to achieve the set RES targets. This is because wind and solar generation, both variable in nature, will remain in the foreseeable future the technologies dominating new renewable installations. The assessment by the European Commission of the NECPs highlights "several shortcomings in the energy market (flexibility through smart grids, storage and limited demand-side response)". In the meantime, the Electricity Regulation establishes network codes and guidelines to be adopted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Consequences of high penetration of wind and solar energy</head><p>Experts and policy makers expect that solar and wind generating technologies will become the cheapest technologies to generate renewable electricity, dominating the growth of renewables in the electricity sector in the next years. This trend is likely to be underpinned by the provisions in the Clean Energy for all Europeans package, requiring that renewable energy targets are met through competitive processes that ensure that the energy transition is achieved at the lowest cost.</p><p>Wind and solar energy are variable in time and inflexible. This creates two main problems for the electricity systems:</p><p>• Balancing of electricity demand and supply: Supply and demand must remain identical at all times for the security of the electricity systems. The sun does not shine and the wind does not blow to match the electricity demand. This has two effects. On the one hand, supply can be higher than demand, e.g. in a residential area with solar panels during working hours. On the other hand, high installed capacity of RES-E cannot secure generation and requires back-up from flexible generation like gas-and coal-fired power plants. Unlike wind and solar, these plants have higher operational costs linked to the fuels' costs and thus are costlier for consumers. Moreover, investors might not get returns if they are mostly used as back-up. To ensure security of supply, some countries are paying to get availability on demand from these plants. Finally, using fossil fuel as a back-up reduces the carbon reduction from RES-E. • Grid congestion: The most cost-efficient locations for solar and wind plants are not always near the areas with high demand for electricity. Transmission of electricity from generation to consumption can result in grid congestion at high voltages, for example from North to South Germany, and at low voltages for decentralized generation, such as prosumers and small energy cooperatives. Reinforcing the grid and installing more interconnections is a costly solution to this problem.( <ref type="formula">22</ref>)</p><p>To increase the penetration of renewables then can be seen from the consumer side. That is, consumption adapting to generation, rather than having generation adapting to consumption. This is often referred to as demand response. The digitalisation of the energy system; development of cheaper and more efficient storage including in electric vehicles; the internet of things, automation and artificial intelligence; consumer behavioural changes; and cross-sector coupling are some of the most important changes in the market facilitating the adoption of demand response solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">The need and costs of flexibility</head><p>The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) in its Market Monitoring Report report for 2018 concluded that "the presence of negative prices emphasises the need for more flexible resources in the system, including demand response" (ACER 2018). Negative electricity prices signal more generation than consumption. This occurs, amongst others, when there is significant inflexible generation such as wind, solar or nuclear, and little demand. The number of instances of negative prices can be correlated to the level of integration of renewables. Negative prices are signalling that it is cheaper to "pay to consume" rather than to stop the plant.( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) This phenomenon ultimately demonstrate the need for flexibility and one of the ways to assess the costs associated with the lack thereof.</p><p>( 22 ) Generation from wind and solar can also cause other grid technical issues, such as frequency, voltage and rotor angle stability. The solution to these issues are provided by the so-called ancillary services, which can also be provided by some flexibility solutions such as batteries. We will not focus on these aspects in this report. ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>)</p><p>An early analysis of April to June 2020 of negative prices (due to lower consumption from Covid-19 and high renewable generation) in Germany and Belgium, a position paper from EnergyVille reaches similar conclusions in terms of the need of more flexibility into the system. https://www.energyville.be/en/press/position-paper-post-covid-recovery-challenges-and-opportunitiesenergy-system</p></div>

According to the Bundesnetzagentur (BNA), the German energy regulator, in 2017 wind supplied record levels of power and 10 200 GWh was curtailed. The cost of stabilising the grid reached €1.4 billion that year (BNA 2017). In 2018 the numbers were lower yet still important, with 7 919 GWh curtailed, with a total cost of stabilising the grid of €635 million (BNA 2018). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Policy developments to foster flexibility</head><p>Demand response is not a new concept, and it has already been used in some form or another in several countries. Some examples:</p><p>• In the 80s, France was relying on inflexible nuclear generation. EDF offered a "peak days / step back" tariff. This had a maximum number of "red days" with high prices, known in advance, where people could react (RAP 2018, IEA 2012). • Several countries set up day and night tariffs, which sometimes include weekends.</p><p>• Large industries have received discounts on grid charges in exchange of responding to system operators requests to lower their peak load. • Aggregators have also large industries in their mix when proposing demand response through for example, capacity mechanisms seeking security of supply.</p><p>Policies at the EU level are facilitating the research and development, and the opening of markets for flexibility and demand response.</p><p>• The Clean Energy for all Europeans Package opens the door to different forms of demand response: changes in the markets to make them more accessible to demand response providers such as aggregators, inclusion of dynamic pricing to trigger demand response through price signals, incentives for the distribution system operators to consider demand response instead of investing in reinforcing the grid are amongst these measures. In particular, the clean energy package includes in the European Electricity Regulation (EU 2019b) that establishes network codes and guidelines to be adopted. The European Commission identified demand side flexibility as one of the two main areas to be developed as a priority through network codes and guidelines during the consultation for prioritization to the development of network codes (EC 2020b).</p><p>• The European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan), a dedicated EU research and development programme, focuses on technologies to transition to a low-carbon economy. The plan covers three areas supporting the development of a flexible system that can integrate more renewables: Smart Energy System, Batteries, Energy Consumers.</p><p>However, the assessment by the European Commission of the NECPs highlights "several shortcomings in the energy market (flexibility through smart grids, storage and limited demand-side response)".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4">How to provide flexibility?</head><p>Behavioural changes. All type of consumers can potentially adapt the way they consume. They will do so depending on many factors, including: the reactivity and flexibility of the equipment in use (notably in industry), loss of comfort (households), and the level of incentives of the household.( <ref type="formula">24</ref>)</p><p>Digitalisation. The electricity sector is becoming more digitalised across Europe. Smart meters are rolled out, and appliances are becoming more connected. They provide almost instantaneous information on consumption to users, networks operators, and potentially to third parties. The remote control could be decided through algorithms, machine learning and eventually artificial intelligence taking into account information from a more digitalised and smarter grid. Moreover, the digitalisation and electrification of vehicles will allow for smarter charging. As JM. Glachant and N. Rossetto put it: "artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things can become unavoidable and automated intermediaries, replacing direct human involvement in thousands of decisions concerning the management of vast sets of assets" (Glachant and Rossetto 2018).</p><p>Storage. Centralised storage, notably hydro pumping storage, is one of the oldest systems of storage. It has the advantage to provide flexibility across seasons. Yet installing new pump storage needs an adequate topography, which is not available necessary near the variable generation, and has environmental impact.</p><p>Other storage technologies have become cheaper and with better features. For example, better reactivity, that is the speed of inputting and extracting electricity at short notice. Other important aspects are their capacity, their life expectancy, their ability to be located near the generation to avoid transmission losses and for how long it is efficient to store energy. ( <ref type="formula">25</ref>)</p><p>The deployment of electric batteries is increasing and they are becoming more affordable, with high levels of reactivity but small amounts of energy storage. Electric vehicles are a double edge solution. On the one hand, without optimisation, they can increase peak demand at the time when most people arrive at home or at work. On the other hand, with automation and connectivity, they can offer important flexibility.</p><p>Power to X. Hydrogen (H2) can be generated via electrolysis. This needs electricity, which can be powered by renewable electricity. When hydrogen is produced with renewables, it is often referred to as green hydrogen( 26 ). Hydrogen is being considered to add flexibility to the grid. Amongst others, it can be used as storage by being transformed back to electricity, as input in some industries or mixing it with natural gas in the grid, which is often called 'sector coupling'.</p><p>( 24 ) Later in this chapter, in the section "Incentives for Flexibility" we will explore the different ways in which economic incentives can be given to users to make them change their behaviour. ( <ref type="formula">25</ref>)</p><p>IRENA developed a framework in this line to valuate different technologies (IRENA 2020a). ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) Note that at the time of this paper no official taxonomy been yet established for hydrogen, making more difficult the task of understanding the actual reduction in carbon from this product.</p><p>A paper by R. Belmans and P. Vingerhoets concludes: "The direct use of hydrogen as a supplier of energy services to the end user is limited. Due to the specific characteristics of the hydrogen molecule (very light, very low boiling temperature, very low energy density), mobile applications are doubtful. For stationary applications, the need for storage of energy is clearly present, but the required volume and the resulting pressure/temperature needs make hydrogen a poor choice. The same holds for strategic energy storage"( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) (Belmans and Vingerhoets 2020).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5">Incentives for flexibility</head><p>For the uptake of flexibility, there needs to be enough return on investments. Moreover, for all investors, and households in particular as they are more risk adverse, price signals or incentives need to be sufficient and predictable lowering the risk to lose out from their investments.</p><p>( 27 )</p><p>The paper also concludes that "[there is a] need for a clear taxonomy of hydrogen. The basis has to be the carbon content in order to ensure carbon neutrality in the most effective way."</p><p>There are two main classifications on the ways to incentivise demand side response (IRENA 2019a):</p><p>• Price-based (or implicit) is when consumer electricity prices vary with the market prices. This gives incentives for consumption to adapt to the price signals. The Directive on Common Rules for the Internal Market for Electricity (EU 2019a) gives the option to consumers who have a smart meter to access this type of pricing, often called a dynamic tariff. CEER recommends that the reference price should be the day ahead price and that "in order to access a dynamic price contract, the customer must have a smart meter that records consumption data at the same granularity as the relevant reference price" <ref type="bibr">(CEER 2018)</ref>. A simplified version of this is the time of use tariffs, more commonly with a price for the day and one for the evening/weekend. For this to optimise the system, variations of prices should perfectly reflect the value and cost of electricity (including balancing) and/or transportation (congestion) in each time periods. Similarly, consumers should easily change their consumption, noting that consumers value significantly their comfort, so to get more buy-in these changes should not have an important impact on their lives. • Incentive-based (or explicit) demand response is when there are organised markets, such as wholesale energy, reserves/balancing, and/or capacity markets proposing flexibility services. For example, a DSOs can organise an auction and pay consumers to change the time of consumption to avoid congestion on the grid. In this way the consumer receives directly a payment for the reduction rather than economise through lower consumption when prices are higher. The so-called (demand) aggregators are agents that act on behalf of consumers, and can pool together a number of consumers so to be able to provide services and avoid risks. Each aggregator will have a different business model to redistribute the benefits across consumers.</p><p>Note that, when well applied, these incentives should contribute to the integration of renewable energy in the system in a cost-efficient manner. The buy in from consumers do not depend only on the benefits they can make individually. They will depend on behavioural aspects: for example, in real life people do not relate equally to something presented as a "saving" than something presented as a "surplus" even when the final amount is the same. Business models and services, such as demand side aggregators, optimization systems in the household, the electric vehicle, apps, or others, that capture these aspects will be essential for its uptake. For this to be possible, there should be a sufficiently large market for new players to test different forms, e.g. not capturing the consumer through long term contracts, or having a de facto monopoly preventing from innovation. It is also important to consider that this innovation, digitalisation and potential forms of control need to ensure consumer's privacy and rights.</p><p>3 Impacts on fossil fuel consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutant emissions</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key messages:</head><p>The increased consumption of renewable energy in 2018 compared with 2005 levels allowed the EU to:</p><p>• reduce its total GHG emissions by 478 MtCO2, equivalent to 12 % of total EU GHG emissions;</p><p>• reduce energy dependence by cutting demand for fossil fuels by 145 Mtoe, or roughly 13 % of total EU fossil fuel consumption;</p><p>• contribute towards energy efficiency targets by statistically reducing the EU's primary energy consumption by 43 Mtoe, equivalent to a 3 % reduction in primary energy consumption across the EU;</p><p>• reduce the emissions for NOx and SO2 by 44 kt and 129 kt, respectively, but increase the emissions of PM10, PM2,5 and VOC by 122 kt, 120 kt and 247 kt respectively.</p><p>Along with energy efficiency, renewable energy is a key decarbonisation pillar of Europe's transition to a low-carbon economy and society. Delivering the commitments under the Paris Agreement will require the EU to cut its GHG emissions by 80 % to 95 % by 2050 (compared with 1990 levels) and to decarbonise the energy generation sector almost completely.</p><p>The EU's renewable energy targets are already one important part of the combined efforts to decarbonise the energy system. Progressing towards them will effectively displace fossil fuels and complement the other climate mitigation efforts. As improvements in energy efficiency gradually reduce our consumption of energy, the growing share of renewables results in a progressively larger displacement of non-renewable energy alternatives.</p><p>To date, the consumption of RES has steadily increased, both as a share of final energy consumption and in absolute numbers. The growth of renewable energy in the mix has already eroded market shares previously held by non-renewable sources, effectively reducing CO2 emissions.</p><p>The following sections estimate the gross effect ( 28 ) of renewable energy on fossil fuel consumption and its associated GHG emissions and then -statistically -on primary energy consumption ( 29 ). The relative reductions in fossil fuel use and GHG emissions ( 30 ) are obtained by comparing actual growth in renewable energy since 2005 with a counterfactual scenario in which this growth would come from nonrenewable energy sources.

On the one hand, this testifies to the more rapid progress achieved since 2005 in decarbonising the EU power sector, compared with transport, heating and cooling, and industry. On the other hand, it hints at the increasing role that RES-E could play in decarbonising other end-use sectors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Effects at EU level</head><p>The main energy efficiency policies at the EU level -the recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) (EU 2010) and the recast Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) (EU 2012b) -set targets and objectives expressed in primary energy consumption (defined as gross inland energy consumption minus final non-energy consumption; see Glossary and Abbreviations). As energy efficiency and renewable energy are key drivers for achieving Europe's climate and energy targets by 2020 and 2030, synergies between RES technologies and their statistical impacts on primary energy ( <ref type="formula">34</ref>) are presented below. The methodology underpinning these findings was described in a previous EEA report (EEA 2015) ( 35 ).</p><p>At the EU level, primary energy consumption followed an intermittent, yet decreasing, trend until 2014, after which it increased again up to 2017 and a marginal decrease of 0.7 % was observed between 2017 and 2018 (EEA 2020b). Next to the key driving factors that affect primary energy consumption, such as energy efficiency improvements, unusual weather conditions and economic activity, several other factors are of statistical importance for the overall trend, given their opposing effects:</p><p>• Typically, a decreasing share of nuclear energy and thermal generation (excluding combined heat and power -CHP) in primary energy consumption is statistically diminishing the latter even if the final energy consumption is constant. Similarly, a growing share of certain renewable energy technologies, such as hydro-and wind power, statistically reduces the level of primary energy consumption, even where final energy use stays unchanged. This is because of the statistical methodologies in use: to estimate the primary energy of certain technologies or sources, energy statistics follow the common physical principle of the first measurable primary equivalent energy. For nuclear and geothermal energy, the first measurable primary equivalent energy is the heat that is being converted to electricity (at transformation efficiencies typically in the range of 40-60 %). In contrast, for solar PV and wind energy, the first measurable primary energy equivalent is the resulting electricity, which thus amounts to a 100 % transformation efficiency for these technologies, thereby improving the overall conversion efficiency of the energy system and statistically lowering the level of primary energy consumption. • General factors driving the accounting of primary energy consumption upwards include an increasing share of specific renewable energy technologies, such as biomass-based electricity production. This is because the efficiency of electricity generation from biomass is, on average, lower than that from fossil fuels. Given these low efficiencies, converting the gross final electricity obtained from biomass into primary energy will, statistically, worsen the overall conversion efficiency of the energy system and thus increase total primary energy consumption.</p><p>The EEA estimates that deploying renewable energy since 2005 reduced primary energy consumption by 42.5 Mtoe in 2018 -more than the primary energy consumption of Czech Republic in 2018 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">27</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">7</ref>). Without the growth in renewable energy since 2005, primary energy consumption in the EU in 2018 could have been 3 % higher, while final energy use in end sectors could have remained unchanged.</p><p>( 34 ) Eurostat's "Primary energy consumption (Europe 2020-2030)". See 1.2.2. ( 35 ) Some changes have been made to the methodology for calculating the effects of renewable energy on primary energy consumption. It is assumed that the use of renewable biofuels does not have an impact on primary energy consumption, because the use of fossil fuels (such as petrol and diesel) is replaced by the same amount of biofuels. Heat extracted from the environment by heat pumps counts as renewable energy. To estimate the effect of heat pumps on fossil energy consumption and primary energy consumption, we assume a seasonal performance factor (SPF) for heat pumps of 3.0.  </p></div>

However, for PM10, PM2.5 and VOC emissions, the result is an increase of respective In more detail, due to the increase in the gross final consumption of RES since 2005, all emissions from the RES-E market sector decreased, except for VOC emissions. The picture is different for the RES-H/C market sector, for which all the emissions increased, except for SO2 emissions.</p><p>Example: For heat non-ETS (essentially corresponding to the residential and services sectors), if it is assumed that 100 PJ of renewable solid fuels have replaced an equivalent amount of energy otherwise supplied with by average fossil fuel mix, this results in higher implied emission factors for all pollutants, except for SO2. This is because, in most cases, less emitting fuels such as natural gas were part of the average fossil fuel mix.</p><p>The larger the initial share of natural gas in the average fossil fuel mix, the higher the relative increase of the implied emission factors associated with the renewable solid fuels.</p><p>The assumption of using a weighted average emission factor for fossil fuels assumed to have been replaced by renewable energy means that, in the case of combustion-based renewables, emissions can increase for some pollutants.

Nevertheless, at the country level the results provide a useful general indication of the influence the increase in renewable energy consumption since 2005 had on air pollutant emissions. This follows from the likely interactions between the mix of renewable energy sources that supplied the energy, on the one hand, and the fossil fuel sources they substituted, on the other hand.     Note that in the above figures (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">28</ref> to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">32</ref>) the map at the right shows the relative change of emissions compared to 2005 due to RES deployment over the national total in 2018 while the second table of Annex 2 shows the relative effect of deploying renewable energy since 2005 on national total air pollutant emissions frozen at 2005 level in 2018.</p><p>In relative terms, for NOx the results vary from a strong decrease to an increase in emissions (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">28</ref>). The strongest decreases are caused by increasing shares of wind energy (both onshore and offshore) and, to a lesser extent, solar photovoltaic (Germany, Italy), which are not offset by an increase of emissions from biogas use in renewable electricity and biomass in renewable heat production.</p><p>For SO2, all countries show a decreasing trend in emissions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">29</ref>), because almost all the fossil fuels have higher implied emission factors than the renewable fuels, except for heat production by installations subject to the ETS.</p><p>For PM2.5, PM10 and VOCs, all countries except for Portugal, Greece and Croatia, show a relative increase of emissions due to RES consumption, against the backdrop of biomass consumption increases in almost all countries over the period.

It has a strong computed average annual growth (CAGR) of 114.4 %.( <ref type="formula">44</ref>). China alone hosted 30 % of the world's renewable power capacity in 2019. Within the 38 % of installed capacity being RES-E, its major capacity base has been from hydropower plants (not including pumped storage), with 326 GW installed by 2019.</p><p>With a series of large-scale projects, hydropower in China increased sharply since the year 2000. The three-gorge project started production in 2003 and became fully functional in 2015, it totalled 22.5 GW.</p><p>The second largest hydropower plant, Xiludou, finished construction in 2014 and has a capacity of almost 14 GW. China reached a peak of annual installations of around 30 GW in 2013. The growth in hydropower capacity has slowed down since then, with only 3 GW installed in 2019.</p><p>On the other hand, wind power capacity saw a large growth between 2010 and 2015, while solar PV was on the lead of new installations from 2015 until now. By the end of 2019, the total installed capacity was 210 GW for wind (+26 GW from the previous year) and 205 GW for solar PV (+30 GW from the previous year).</p><p>India has multiplied its RES-E capacity over the period 2005-2019 by a factor of 3.5 (from 36 GW to 128 GW).

World total capacity 2019 2,533 GWe installed capacity. India has doubled the wind capacity in the last 5 years, and multiplied by 10 the solar PV capacity in the same period, reaching respectively 37 GW (only onshore wind) and 35 GW in 2019.</p><p>By the end of 2019, Brazil had an 83 % total installed capacity from RES-E and 76 % of this is coming from hydro, accounting for 109 GW installed capacity, from 62 GW in 2005. Wind had a strong and steady growth of around 2 GW installed capacity per year from 2015 to 2019. Solar PV saw a boom in installed capacity in 2017 and 2018 with 1 GW installed per year. However, net installed capacity of both sources of renewables slowed down in 2019, with around 0.5 GW installed capacity each that year (IRENA 2020a).</p><p>The rest of the ASOC currently has 260 GW installed renewable capacity. The region saw a year on year growth of 12 % for the region, one of the highest just after the Middle East at 14 % growth, and above the 7.7 % average growth since 2012. This meant a 28 GW net addition, under the 63 GW in China and just above the EU additions, which stand at 26 GW. The increases in 2019 were above 2018 levels, with 23 GW additions, an 11 % growth. This shows a sharp acceleration in these two years, when compared to 13 GW addition and 6 % growth in 2017.</p></div>

This is thanks to a legacy of high hydropower capacity. In per capita terms, RES-E has grown steadily over time, from 0.4 kW/capita in 2005 to 0.7 kW/capita in 2019. As the RES-E basis was already strong at the beginning of the period, growth in capacity per capita is small compared to countries in the same group, 3.7 % average since 2005, and 3.4 % in 2019.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EU, the UK and the United States</head><p>EU more than doubled its installed renewable capacity over the period 2005-2019, from 174 GW to 449 GW. With 167 GW capacity, wind power was the EU's largest renewable power source in 2019, followed by hydropower at 129 GW (not including pumped storage). Solar PV capacity was 116 GW. The EU remains leader in CSP, with 2.3 GW of CSP in Spain, the largest capacity in the world. Wind power and solar PV accounted for 90 % of the annual increase in renewable power capacity, and offshore wind power represented around 25 % of the total European wind power market in 2019 (IRENA 2020a).</p><p>In the US, the renewable installed capacity amounted to 265 GW in 2019. With 104 GW of capacity in 2019, wind dominates RES-E total installed capacity. It is followed by hydro with a capacity of 84 GW, not including pumped storage, which has not seen much changes since 2010. Despite having less capacity installed, solar PV capacity has skyrocketed since 2005: from 0.5 GW to 60.5 GW in 2019. The US also has a CSP capacity of 1.8 GW, second after Spain, and way ahead of other countries.</p><p>The UK had 47 GW of renewable installed capacity in 2019. Wind is the dominating technology, with 24 GW total installed capacity in 2019, almost 60 % of which is onshore. Solar PV comes next, with 14 GW installed capacity, of which 3 GW of new capacity was installed in 2019, a 7 % annual growth. This is the lowest level of annual net installed capacity since 2011. More than half of this growth was offshore wind.</p><p>In terms of indicators relative to the size of the countries and groups of countries:</p><p>• By 2019 the EU had established itself as one of the world leaders in terms of installed capacity per capita. At 1 kW per capita in 2019, this measure has increased every year starting from 2005. 46 It had an average annual growth of 6.8 % since 2005, the year on year growth of 6.1 %, showing a slight deceleration.

(IRENA 2020a) the United States performance of installed capacity per unit GDP, 18 kW/million EUR2017 (PPP), was below the world average in 2019. The growth in this parameter for the United States stagnated after a growth period in 2005-2010.</p><p>( 46 )</p><p>The per capita capacity in Europe has grown due to the exclusion of the UK from the EU data.

The region had in 2019 a 0.5 kW per capita ratio, and 37 kW/million EUR2017 (PPP).</p><p>European and CIS countries outside the EU and UK, includes western and north European countries, as well as Eastern European and CIS countries. This is a very heterogeneous group of countries in terms of RES penetration, electricity generation, GDP and population. It is also very diverse in terms of the types of RES technologies that have been developed and their potential future net installations. Russia and Turkey are leaders in the region's total installed capacity with 53 GW and 45 GW respectively in 2019, representing 51 % of the regions' installed capacity. Norway and Switzerland follow with 35 GW and 17 GW installed respectively. Ukraine was the country with most net installations in the region in 2019 with 4.6 GW installed capacity, reaching 12.7 GW of total installed capacity. Turkey was the second country in terms of net installations in 2019 with 2.4 GW, and has been the country with largest growth in the last years, with 16.7 GW net installed between the end of 2014 and the end of 2019 (IRENA 2020a).</p><p>Turkey and the Russian Federation 48 have kept increasing their hydro capacity, with 4 GW and 0.5 GW installed in the last five years respectively, whereas Norway installed 1.4 GW. Turkey has been the fastest growing in terms of RES-E installation, with more than 16 GW installed in the last five years. Turkey have increased its solar PV capacity by over 6.2 GW in the last 5 years. Turkey also installed 3.8 GW of wind power in the last 5 years, whereas Norway installed 1.6 GW (IRENA 2020a).</p><p>The installed capacity per capita and GDP in the other European (except for the UK) and CIS countries region is relatively low per capita, at 0.5 kW per capita, and around the world average for GDP at 29 per unit of GDP in million constant EUR2017 (PPP).</p><p>The Middle East had 23 GW of RES-E total renewable installed capacity in 2019, with an annual increase of 14 %, almost 3 GW of capacity. Half of this increase happened in the United Arab Emirates. The Middle East has 0.09 kW of RES-E capacity per capita, one of the lowest in the world comparing the RES-E resource base with the size of the Middle East's economy reveals that it remains a region of weak performance on this parameter: 8.2 kW per unit of GDP in million constant EUR2017 (PPP). Furthermore, there are no signs yet that the speed of transforming the energy resource base of the Middle East's economy is picking up.</p><p>Africa had 48.4 GW of installed RES-E capacity in 2019, with a year on year increase of 2 GW. More than half of this newly installed capacity was in Egypt. The region had one of the lowest per capita ratio, with 0.04 kW/capita. This can be linked to low levels of electrification in the region, while having a relatively high population growth. Africa has 10.9 kW per unit of GDP in million constant EUR2017 (PPP).</p></div>

With a 12 % average in the last 5 years, this latest quintenary has been much slower than previous periods, specially the one from 2005 to 2010 (IRENA 2020a). China is the largest country with installed capacity, with 205 GW, 34 % of the worlds installed capacity. Its growth has been slower in 2019 than in the previous 5 years average, with 14 % in 2019 (or 30 GW added) when compared to 17 %. It is nevertheless higher than in 2018, which saw a growth of 12 %. The EU with 116 GW maintains second position, with an added 14 GW from the previous years.</p><p>Solar PV and wind accounted for 23 % and 25% of the total installed renewable capacity.

Offshore wind saw a growth of 20 % in new capacity installation in 2019, as compared to 25 % in the previous year and a 27% average in the last 5 years. China's offshore market had seen a particularly sharp increase, with a peak growth in 2016 of 165 %. Since then, the growth has slowed down, yet China remains a main contributor of worldwide offshore market in 2019, accounting for around 30 % of the new global capacity.</p><p>The EU was the leader in the wind market until 2015, when China took the lead in terms of installed capacity. China had an average growth of 17 % in the last 5 years, and overtaking the EU-27 ( <ref type="formula">49</ref>). The United States has had a fast growth as well, as have some regions and countries around the world but remain far from EU and China.

This share is very heterogeneous across the world. Nine countries produced more than 20% of their electricity from wind and solar in 2019, with Denmark again a clear leader at 60 %. Many countries are making efforts to integrate more variable renewable generation in their systems, notably by expanding or modernising grid infrastructure to achieve higher levels of flexibility, or investing in new transmission lines. (REN21 2020) (see also section 2.3 on flexibility in the grid to integrate more variable renewable generation).</p><p>By the end of 2019, Solar PV and Solar CSP produced in 2019 close to 715 TWh and 16 TWh of electricity respectively. Solar PV represented around 2.8 % of annual global electricity generation and 22 % of renewable electricity generation. Solar PV continues to play a significant and growing role in electricity generation in several countries. Despite growth of capacity and decreased curtailment, grid connected solar PV generation accounted for only 3 % of total generation, compared to 2.7 % in 2018, with a total generation of 224 TWh (an increase of 27 % compared to the previous year). This low penetration China despite growth in the PV market is due to skyrocketing demand increase in China. In some other countries there is a high penetration of solar PV on the energy mix: it accounted for around 10.7 % of total generation in Honduras and substantial shares also in Italy (8.6 %), Greece (8.3 %), Germany (8.2 %), and Chile (8.1 %) (REN21 2020).</p><p>In 2019, wind energy covered an estimated 5.9 % of global generation.

In Germany, wind generation accounted for 21.8 % of total electricity generation, with a sharp increase of 12 % and 27 % of onshore and offshore generation respectively. In China, despite a rapid growth of wind capacity and generation (11 %), the also fastgrowing electricity consumption meant that wind represented 5.5 % of total generation (up from 5.2 % in 2018).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Growth in renewable energy investments</head><p>Between 2005 and 2007, renewable energy investments saw an increase in most regions. In 2008 and 2009, the economic crisis affected liquidity and slowed down the growth in renewable energy investments. Investment growth recovered quickly in 2010, when most industries were still recovering from or still affected by the crisis. But in 2011 the growth in investments started to slow down again. The period from 2005 to 2011, was dominated by low policy uncertainty but strongly affected by the crisis.</p><p>Europe was dominating the market from the beginning of the period and had an average annual growth of 23 %. Yet the most significant growth was in China, the United States and India (despite the two latter having negative growth during the economic crisis), with average annual growth of 31 %, 24 % and 25 % respectively.</p><p>( 51 ) CIS refers to the Commonwealth of Independent States. For full details, please see geographical notations in the glossary.</p><p>Overall, during the period 2005-2011, global investments showed a growing trend although there were increases and decreases in different countries. Yet, in 2012, for the first time, total investments declined.</p><p>The following year saw an even sharper decline. In Europe and the United States, where most of the investments were taking place until that year, policy uncertainties and retroactive policy changes took place, shaking investors' confidence. Moreover low natural gas prices, due to the rapidly increasing shale gas extractions in the United States, attracted the interest of investors in the gas supply chain and power plants. India and Brazil also saw a decline in investments. Since during that period they represented a small fraction of the global investments, these reductions have less impact than those of the EU and the United States. In the meantime, investments in ASOC, China, and the Americas (except Brazil and Unites States) grew during that period.</p><p>Investments in renewables took a positive turn again in 2014-2015. Since then, investments have been fluctuating significantly between growth and degrowth with multiple factors affecting regional and global investments (Frankfurt School-UNEP 2020).</p><p>In 2019, the global investments increased by 3%, after a decrease of 15 % in 2018, with levels still below the peaks in 2017 and 2015 (EUR 287.7 billion and EUR 287 billion respectively) ( <ref type="formula">52</ref>). Despite a significant increase of investments in the United States, and increases in India and Brazil, these were counterbalanced by the decreases of investments in China and Europe.</p><p>China, the country with the highest investments in 2019, shrunk its investments by 6 %, reaching its lowest level of investment since 2013. This is driven by cutbacks of the government support in solar PV by limiting access to the feed-in-tariff. This despite the lower costs of this technology. The decline in solar PV was moderated by investments in wind energy, amongst others due to the feed-in-tariff for offshore wind that finished at the end of 2019 (Frankfurt School-UNEP 2020).</p><p>Europe also saw a reduction of 7% in investments. This is due to less capacity in off-shore wind. However, this trend might be reverted as many large investments of off-shore wind projects are on the pipeline for the upcoming years. The United States growth in investments, of 26 %, was mostly driven by investors wanting to take advantage of a tax credit in onshore wind before its ending.

Except for hydro, the estimates include direct and indirect jobs, and traditional biomass is not included as a source of renewable energy( 54 ). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">40</ref> shows the countries with larger absolute number of jobs in the sector. Like the previous years, China, the EU and Brazil were the largest employers, accounting together more than half of the global renewable energy workforce. China accounted for 4.4 million jobs (37 %), the EU for 1.15 million jobs (10 %) and Brazil for 1.15 million jobs (10 %) respectively (solid blue bars in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">40</ref>). Adding the 5 largest employers, that is including India and the United States, shows further concentration with almost three quarters of the global renewable energy jobs. Most of the leading countries being based in Asia, these regions accounted for 63% of total jobs in renewables.</p><p>In the EU( 55 ), it is estimated that there are 1.3 million jobs in renewable energy, with 0.15 million based in the UK. Within the EU, Germany was the larger country, with 309 thousand jobs. The largest employer is the bioenergy sector, with a total of 0.7 million jobs (including UK). Wind followed with 292 thousand jobs, 44 thousand of which in the UK. Germany tops the ranking in Europe, with 309 thousand jobs, but the employment in the sector has been declining since 2011 when it reached the peak of 417 thousand jobs. France was another large employer, with roughly 90 thousand jobs. Other countries like Spain have seen an increase in jobs for renewables, and new European directives lowering barriers for solar PV installations could help further increase the employment in the sector.</p><p>Some of the main countries kept establishing themselves as world leaders, China, Brazil and India saw an increase of jobs in 2019, with 7 %, 3 % and 15 % respectively. In the meantime, other large countries lost jobs in the sector in 2019. For example, EU, United States and Japan respectively by 3 %, 13 % and 11 %.</p><p>The ROW saw an increase of 2 % of jobs, showing a slight redistribution towards traditionally less dominant countries.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">40</ref> also presents renewable jobs in relative terms for the selected countries and the rest of the world, i.e. renewable energy related jobs as the percentage share of the total labour force in the country -the blue-dotted bars in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">40</ref>. Malaysia and Brazil are the top two countries with respect to renewable energy-related jobs as percentages of the labour force in 2019, with 1.19 % and 1.09 %. They are far ahead to the third ranked, the EU at 0.66 %. At the global level, on average 0.33 % of the labour force is engaged in the renewable energy sector.</p><p>Solar PV, with 3.8 million jobs, accounted for 33 % of the world's renewable energy workforce in 2019, while bioenergy is now at 3.5 million jobs, accounting for 31 % of renewables jobs.( <ref type="formula">56</ref>) China hosted more than half of the PV employment, some 2.2 million jobs.( 57 ) Bioenergy jobs have been growing fast, with a 9 % growth in 2019 and 13 % in 2018, with the main employment being in biofuels. Solar growth in the last two years have been 7 % and 2 % respectively.</p><p>(  </p></div>

For some countries, these differences can be larger, especially when looking at the amount of RES-T. These differences can stem from different methodologies used by countries following the adoption of the ILUC Directive (EU, 2015a), as well as from the difficulty of replicating the specific accounting rules in the RED concerning very specific shares of RES-T (see also Section 1.2.2). At the EU level, approximated RES share was estimated to be 0.1 percentage points higher than the final RES share published by Eurostat. Sectoral RES shares were overestimated in transport by 0.3 percentage points, RES-E by 0.0 percentage points and for heating and cooling by 0.1 percentage points.</p><p>Deviations in RES shares are less than 4.0 percentage point for all Member States, and deviations are larger than 1 percentage point in six Member States. At sectoral level, deviations are larger than 1 percentage point in seven Member States for RES-E shares, in eleven Member States for RES-T shares and in twelve Member States for RES-H&amp;C shares. Short-term proxy estimates are most difficult in the heating and cooling sector. This is mainly the result of two effects: (1) on the one hand, bioenergy is the predominant renewable energy source in this sector, but useful data sources are unavailable there; (2) on the other hand, gross final energy consumption in the heating and cooling sector is hard to estimate due to the strong influence of climatic conditions.</p><p>For some Member States, the deviation between proxy and final data for 2018 is considerable.

To reduce indirect land use impacts owing to biofuels and bioliquids, the Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) Directive of 2015 (EU 2015a) attempted to tackle -among other things -these concerns. It limited the share of biofuels from crops grown on agricultural land to 7 % and obliged Member States to establish indicative national targets for advanced biofuels (second/third generation) for 2020, with a reference value of 0.5 %. Annex IX of the ILUC Directive also harmonised the list of feedstocks whose contribution would count double towards the 2020 national target of a 10 % share of RES-T. For electricity produced from RES and consumed by electric road vehicles and rail transport, the ILUC Directive increases the multiplier factors for calculating the market share of RES-T. It increased the minimum reduction threshold for GHG emissions applied to biofuels produced in new installations, and it obliged fuel suppliers to report annually the provisional mean values of the estimated ILUC emissions from biofuels traded (EU 2015b).</figDesc></figure>

The analysis for the accompanying Communication on stepping up Europe's 2030 climate ambition shows that higher shares of renewables are fundamental to achieve higher GHG emissions reduction targets. As set out in the impact assessment, reducing GHG emissions by at least 55 % would require a share of renewable energy in the EU of 38-40% by 2030 (EC 2020a). These levels of renewable energy are not yet translated in Member State's NECPs of 2019.</figDesc><table /></figure>

According to preliminary estimates calculated by the EEA, the RES share continued to grow in 2019, reaching an estimated 19.5 % share in gross final consumption ( ). If the UK is taken into account too, the RES share across the EU-28 would have increased from 9.1 % in 2005 to 18.0 % in 2018. The EU-28 RES share would have reached to 18.7 % according the EEA early estimates. This would be almost 1 % lower than the current EU share.• In 2018, the RES share exceeded the trajectory that can be ascribed to the EU on the basis of the indicative trajectories of the Member States under theRED (16.6 % in 2018(12)). The EU almost reached the trajectory level of 19.2 %, expected in accordance with the NREAPs.

At the end of 2019, a new CSP installation with approximately 9 MW capacity came into operation in the French Pyrenees and brought the total capacity to 2 323 MW (EurObserv'ER 2020b). • Geothermal electricity grew by only 2 percentage points per year, on average, to reach 0.6 Mtoe in 2018. No significant change was expected in 2019. • Electricity generation from tidal, wave and ocean energy remained at only 41 ktoe in 2018, and no significant change was expected in 2019. • Electricity production from certified bioliquids decreased by 2 % from 2017 to 2018 and remained at a moderate level, 0.4 Mtoe, in 2018.

On the relative level, comparing to total emissions frozen at 2005 level, the additional consumption of renewable energy sources across the EU since 2005 has led to a decrease of SO2 and NOx emissions in 2018, by 6 % and 1 %, respectively, than if RES use had remained at the same level of 2005. In contrast, an indicative increase of EU-wide emissions for PM and VOCs took place in 2018, following the increase in biomass use since 2005 (by 12 % for PM2.5, 7 % for PM10 and 4 % for VOCs) (see second table of Annex 2).</figDesc><table /></figure>

Wind investments increased year on year by 11%, while solar had a slight decrease of 2 %.The investments in fossil and nuclear capacity decreased, with EUR 88 billion in 2019 compared to EUR 104 billion in 2018 -consisting of EUR 33 billion for coal plants, EUR 42 billion for gas-fired plants, and EUR 13.4 billion for new nuclear capacity. Investments in wind and solar were more than 3 times the investments in gas and coal-fired power plants.Despite a decline in investments since 2017, China continues to invest in renewable energy significantly more than any other country: EUR 79 billion in 2019. This is the lowest level since 2015 and 6 % under the investments in 2018. India's investments, which are far lower than those of China, also dropped from EUR 9.7 billion in 2018 to EUR 8.3 billion in 2019. China remains the major lead in investments in renewable energy in developing countries.Despite the drop in Chinese and Indian investments, the overall investments in renewables in developing countries increased by 5 %, from EUR 129 billion in 2018 to EUR 136 billion in 2019. There was also an increase in investments in developed countries from EUR 108 billion in 2018 to EUR 116 billion in 2019. The last time developed economies invested more than developing countries was back in 2014. UNEP 2020 report states that the Covid-19 crisis has slowed down deal-making in renewables in recent months, similar as in other sectors, and predicts that this will affect, negatively, investment levels in 2020. It encourages governments to shape their economic recovery strategies towards more green jobs and investments, and to accelerate the phase-out of non-renewable sources. 4.2.1 Share in global renewable energy investments Throughout the period 2005-2012, Europe (including CIS) ( 51 ) dominated global new investments in renewable energy (see Table 17).

The data have been updated to reflect the most up-to-date values available at the end of July 2020, when no officially reported RES data for 2019 were available. Some improvements in the methodology were made for the estimation of 2016 RES shares:• The calculation is made in Eurostat's Short Assessment of Renewable Energy Sources (SHARES) tool. This improves consistency with the methodology laid out in the RED and RES shares data published by Eurostat. An exponential trend extrapolation, instead of a linear extrapolation, is used as the standard fall-back option. Variables, data sources and methods used in the RES proxy calculation: Mixed hydro without pumping; Trend change on Hydro provisional, Eurostat. Discontinued in Eurostat Early estimate and not in nrg_cb_e. • Wind; Trend change on Eurostat Supply, transformation and consumption of electricity (nrg_cb_e), Eurostat. • Offshore wind capacity; Trend change on WindEurope.

The country specific method starts from the energy content of the fuel consumed similar as the current/default method but seeks to use a country specific NCV to estimate a country specific CO2 emissions factor. The emission factors from Commission Regulation 601/2012 (Annex VI) (EU 2012a) are related to net calorific values per fuel type. We assume that the net calorific value of a certain fuel type is directly proportional with the CO2 emission factor for that fuel type. It can be that a country uses a fuel type with small deviation in characteristics from the default from Annex VI but it is then assumed that the related CO2 emission factor deviates proportional. That is why we use this relationship to calculate the country specific CO2 emission factor by using the country specific NCV.</p><p>Sources for the data are:</p><p>• Eurostat, Complete energy balances, nrg_bal_c: for input and output data for electricity and heat. </p></div>			</div>

		<title level="a" type="main">investments in wind power grew rapidly and made up the largest share of total investments. In 2010, solar energy became slightly above wind investments. Since then, solar has received larger investments than wind, although it also suffered more year on year volatility. Since 2017, solar investments have been declining, while wind saw a sharp increase in 2019. China cut down its support to solar PV. As the largest country for renewable investments, this has a significant impact at the global scale. This led to an interesting shift in this market. While utility-scale project investments dropped by 19 %, investments in small-scale solar systems, jumped 30 % to EUR 58.3 billion. This is due to sharp decreases in the costs of small installations. Investment in other renewable technologies, such as biomass, waste-to-energy, small-scale hydropower and geothermal power, remained relatively small over the period 2005-2019. Biofuels experienced a steady growth in new investment from 2005 to 2007, with first-generation biofuels. After 2008, investments in biofuels started to decline with some minor fluctuations</title>
